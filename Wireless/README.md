=====================

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Coverage Simulation.

This program simulate the WSN coverage. Each point simulate a distance unit (e.g. foot).

My program read the input data from the STDIN according to the requirements. The algorithm is not optimized so the calculating time is a little long for some special input data.


### Original requirements
See the requirements in p2.pdf
